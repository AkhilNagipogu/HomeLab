# 🏠 Homelab Documentation

This repository contains documentation of my personal **homelab setup** and the services I run.

I use **Proxmox VE** as the base hypervisor, with multiple virtual machines and containers running on top of it.  
For a personal homelab, Proxmox is a great choice due to its flexibility, ease of use, and powerful virtualization features.

> ⚠️ Warning: Homelabbing is highly addictive 🙂

## 🧱 Base Setup

- **Hypervisor:** Proxmox VE  
- **Workloads:** Virtual Machines + Containers

## 🔑 Essential Services

These are the **core services** Which i think i ever homelab must have.

    1. Twingate
    Secure remote access to my homelab without exposing ports.

    2. Cloudflare Tunnel  
    Safely exposes selected local services and websites to the internet.

    3. TrueNAS  
    Used for centralized storage and file management.

To keep the setup simple:
- I use a  **lightweight container** runs Twingate and Cloudflare Tunnel and
- A **dedicated VM** runs TrueNAS (It demands a saparate VM 🙄)

This setup covers access, storage, and external connectivity to my lab, well OfCourse Securly

## 🎯 Why This Homelab?

Well obivousely to show off 😎  (cough cough.....)

For me it was a dream to have a homelab After watching Network chuck videos, I mean his videos on **IT** and **tech software** are way to Good.

Well i try to learn the following.

- Learn Linux and system administration
- Understand virtualization and containers
- Experiment with self-hosted services
- Gain real-world experience beyond theory

Yeah, This chatGPT. Not try to show off with fancy words but, Basically thats what i learn, atleast try to learn.
